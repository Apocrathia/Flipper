# Flipper Zero SD Card Management System

This repository provides a streamlined system to build and maintain a comprehensive Flipper Zero SD card with the latest community content from UberGuidoZ's curated collection.

## üìÅ Repository Overview

This system automatically organizes content from UberGuidoZ's Flipper repository into a properly structured SD card:

- **Content Source**: [UberGuidoZ's Flipper Repository](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper) (via Playground directory)
- **Automation**: Single script handles everything automatically

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts Overview

### `build-sd.sh` - Complete Solution ‚≠ê
The main script that handles everything:
- **Updates** Playground repository automatically (latest UberGuidoZ content)
- **Builds** content locally on fast NVMe drive (SD card friendly)
- **Organizes** content into proper Flipper directory structure
- **Checks** if content fits on SD card before deployment
- **Deploys** everything to your SD card efficiently
- **Reports** comprehensive deployment summary

## üì¶ Content Categories

Your SD card will be organized with:

| Category | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **BadUSB** | Keystroke injection payloads | `/badusb/playground/` |
| **Sub-GHz** | Radio frequency captures & tools | `/subghz/playground/` |
| **NFC** | Near-field communication files | `/nfc/playground/` |
| **Infrared** | IR remote control databases | `/infrared/playground/` |
| **RFID** | RFID tag files and utilities | `/rfid/playground/` |
| **Music Player** | RTTTL tones and audio files | `/music_player/playground/` |
| **Applications** | External FAP applications | `/apps/playground/` |
| **GPIO** | Hardware interfacing tools | `/gpio/playground/` |
| **Graphics** | Flipper animations and artwork | `/apps_data/playground/` |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Flipper Zero SD card mounted at `/Volumes/FLIPPER SD/`
- Git installed for repository updates
- Sufficient SD card space (recommended: 32GB+)

### Simple Usage
**One command does everything:**
```bash
./build-sd.sh
```

This single command will:
1. ‚úÖ Update repository to latest content
2. ‚úÖ Build everything locally (protects SD card)
3. ‚úÖ Check if content fits on SD card
4. ‚úÖ Deploy to SD card
5. ‚úÖ Show comprehensive summary

### Optional Commands
```bash
./clean-sd.sh        # Clean playground content only
./copy-sd.sh         # Copy without updating (legacy)
```

### Advanced Usage
- **Custom mount point**: Edit scripts to change `/Volumes/FLIPPER\ SD/` path
- **Content filtering**: Modify mappings array in `build-sd.sh` to exclude categories

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Legal & Ethical Use
- **Educational Purpose**: This content is for security research and education
- **Authorization Required**: Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Know Your Laws**: Some tools may be restricted in your jurisdiction

### Technical Notes
- Scripts assume macOS environment with standard SD card mounting
- **SD card protection**: Builds locally first, then deploys (reduces flash wear)
- **Space checking**: Automatically verifies content will fit before deployment
- Scripts will overwrite content in "playground" directories only
- External applications require compatible Flipper firmware

### Storage Requirements
- Repository download: ~2-4GB
- Full SD card deployment: ~4-8GB (varies with content updates)
- Recommended SD card: 32GB Class 10 or better

## üìÇ Directory Structure

```
Flipper/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-sd.sh          # Main deployment script (everything you need!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clean-sd.sh          # Optional cleanup script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ copy-sd.sh           # Legacy deployment script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Playground/          # UberGuidoZ repository content (auto-managed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SD/                 # Working directory (created/cleaned automatically)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## ü§ù Content Source

### UberGuidoZ's Flipper Repository
- **Repository**: https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper
- **Content**: Comprehensive, curated collection of Flipper Zero files
- **Quality**: High - actively maintained and community-vetted
- **Updates**: Automatic via `build-sd.sh`
- **Organization**: Automatically sorted into proper Flipper directory structure

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Updates
**Simple workflow:**
```bash
./build-sd.sh    # Updates repository + deploys latest content
```

Run this monthly or whenever you want the latest community content.

### Troubleshooting
- **Mount Issues**: Verify SD card path with `ls /Volumes/`
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure SD card is writable
- **Space Issues**: Script will warn you - consider larger SD card or content filtering
- **Git Errors**: Check internet connection and repository access
- **Size Problems**: Check script output for space requirements vs. available space

## üéØ What Makes This Better

### Efficiency
- **Single command**: No multi-step workflows
- **Local building**: Protects SD card from excessive writes
- **Smart deployment**: Only copies when content fits
- **Automatic updates**: Always gets latest content

### Safety
- **Space checking**: Prevents SD card overflow
- **Content isolation**: Only affects playground directories
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error checking and reporting
- **Backup friendly**: Preserves existing non-playground content

### Maintainability
- **Clean code**: Well-structured, documented scripts
- **Easy mapping**: Simple array-based content organization
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new content categories
- **Cross-platform ready**: Designed for easy adaptation to other OS
