# Flipper Zero SD Card Management System

This repository provides a streamlined system to build and maintain a comprehensive Flipper Zero SD card with the latest community content from UberGuidoZ's curated collection.

## üìÅ Repository Overview

This system automatically organizes content from UberGuidoZ's Flipper repository into a properly structured SD card:

- **Content Source**: [UberGuidoZ's Flipper Repository](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper) (via Playground directory)
- **Automation**: Single script handles everything automatically

## üõ†Ô∏è Script Overview

### `build-sd.sh` - Complete Solution ‚≠ê

The main script that handles everything:

- **Updates** Playground repository automatically (latest UberGuidoZ content)
- **Builds** content locally on fast NVMe drive (SD card friendly)
- **Organizes** content into proper Flipper directory structure
- **Checks** if content fits on SD card before deployment (with buffer)
- **Cleans** OS metadata files (like .DS_Store) from both working directory and SD card, with interactive prompts
- **Deploys** everything to your SD card efficiently (only affects playground directories)
- **Reports** a comprehensive deployment summary
- **Handles errors** robustly and cleans up after failures

## üì¶ Content Categories

Your SD card will be organized with:

| Category         | Description                      | Location                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **BadUSB**       | Keystroke injection payloads     | `/badusb/playground/`       |
| **Sub-GHz**      | Radio frequency captures & tools | `/subghz/playground/`       |
| **NFC**          | Near-field communication files   | `/nfc/playground/`          |
| **Infrared**     | IR remote control databases      | `/infrared/playground/`     |
| **RFID**         | RFID tag files and utilities     | `/rfid/playground/`         |
| **Music Player** | RTTTL tones and audio files      | `/music_player/playground/` |
| **Applications** | External FAP applications        | `/apps/playground/`         |
| **GPIO**         | Hardware interfacing tools       | `/gpio/playground/`         |
| **Graphics**     | Flipper animations and artwork   | `/apps_data/playground/`    |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Flipper Zero SD card mounted at `/Volumes/FLIPPER SD/`
- Git installed for repository updates
- Sufficient SD card space (recommended: 32GB+)

### Simple Usage

**One command does everything:**

```bash
./build-sd.sh
```

This single command will:

1. ‚úÖ Update repository to latest content
2. ‚úÖ Build everything locally (protects SD card)
3. ‚úÖ Check if content fits on SD card (with buffer)
4. ‚úÖ Prompt to clean OS metadata files (optional)
5. ‚úÖ Deploy to SD card
6. ‚úÖ Show comprehensive summary

### Advanced Usage

- **Custom mount point**: Edit the `SD_MOUNT` variable in `build-sd.sh` to change `/Volumes/FLIPPER SD/` path
- **Content filtering**: Modify the script logic to exclude categories if needed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Legal & Ethical Use

- **Educational Purpose**: This content is for security research and education
- **Authorization Required**: Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Know Your Laws**: Some tools may be restricted in your jurisdiction

### Technical Notes

- Script assumes macOS environment with standard SD card mounting
- **SD card protection**: Builds locally first, then deploys (reduces flash wear)
- **Space checking**: Automatically verifies content will fit before deployment, with a safety buffer
- Script will overwrite content in "playground" directories only
- External applications require compatible Flipper firmware
- **Metadata cleanup**: Script scans for and can remove OS metadata files (like .DS_Store) from both the working directory and SD card, with user confirmation
- **Error handling**: If any step fails, the script cleans up and exits safely

### Storage Requirements

- Repository download: ~2-4GB
- Full SD card deployment: ~4-8GB (varies with content updates)
- Recommended SD card: 32GB Class 10 or better

## üìÇ Directory Structure

```
Flipper/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-sd.sh          # Main deployment script (everything you need!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Playground/          # UberGuidoZ repository content (auto-managed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SD/                  # Working directory (created/cleaned automatically)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # This file
```

## ü§ù Content Source

### UberGuidoZ's Flipper Repository

- **Repository**: https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper
- **Content**: Comprehensive, curated collection of Flipper Zero files
- **Quality**: High - actively maintained and community-vetted
- **Updates**: Automatic via `build-sd.sh`
- **Organization**: Automatically sorted into proper Flipper directory structure

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Updates

**Simple workflow:**

```bash
./build-sd.sh    # Updates repository + deploys latest content
```

Run this monthly or whenever you want the latest community content.

### Troubleshooting

- **Mount Issues**: Verify SD card path with `ls /Volumes/`
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure SD card is writable
- **Space Issues**: Script will warn you - consider larger SD card or content filtering
- **Git Errors**: Check internet connection and repository access
- **Metadata Files**: Script will prompt to clean up OS metadata files if found
- **Size Problems**: Check script output for space requirements vs. available space

## üéØ What Makes This Better

### Efficiency

- **Single command**: No multi-step workflows
- **Local building**: Protects SD card from excessive writes
- **Smart deployment**: Only copies when content fits (with buffer)
- **Automatic updates**: Always gets latest content
- **Metadata cleanup**: Optionally removes unnecessary files for a clean SD card

### Safety

- **Space checking**: Prevents SD card overflow
- **Content isolation**: Only affects playground directories
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error checking and reporting
- **Backup friendly**: Preserves existing non-playground content

### Maintainability

- **Clean code**: Well-structured, documented script
- **Easy mapping**: Dynamic directory mapping for content organization
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new content categories
- **Cross-platform ready**: Designed for easy adaptation to other OS
